RF Independent Study Microstrip Project

Requirements:
Make sure
1.	You enter (prefer a GUI) the material and geometry values
  a.	Try pyQt6 if you are adventurous
2.	Calculates characteristic impedance
3.	Calculates phase velocity
4.	Calculates the electrical length 

My program calculates all of the required values, as well as some intermediate values for the calculation. If need be, these can also be included in the output, but currently they are not to avoid overwhelming the user with information.
